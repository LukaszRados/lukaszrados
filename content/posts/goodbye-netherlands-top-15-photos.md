published_at: '2019-08-31'
intro: In just few days I am moving out of the Netherlands where I have lived for the last three years. During these years I met many wonderful people, made countless memories and, obviously, taken hundreds of photos. I had a look at my archive and selected 15 of my favourite pictures.

These three years in the Netherlands were a really intense time in terms of photography. After all most of the photos for the <nuxt-link to="/blog">Project 52 in 2018</nuxt-link> were taken here. Sometimes photography was taking all of my free time: every spring I was spending dozens of hours taking photos of tulips. I learnt to like the Dutch coast and use frequent weather changes to my advantage; I found out that Dutch towns and villages are a perfect playground for the cityscape photography.
